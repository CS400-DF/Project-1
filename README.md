# COVID-19 Status Tracker App
Our app will allow us to track the COVID-19 health status of all students at a university. It will allow a user to input a student’s ID number as the key to search and the Student object that matches that ID number will be the value that is returned from the database. A Student object will consist of the individual’s Name, Living Location (on campus or off campus), and COVID-19 Health Status (positive, negative, waiting for result).

This is written in Java and implements hashtables and hash-functions.
